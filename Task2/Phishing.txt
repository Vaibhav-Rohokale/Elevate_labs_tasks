As in my phishing Awareness Demo project, I have checked the wheather email ids contains phishing related keywords and also same for Urls

What we shall check in emails and website:
 1) We must check the senders email carefully
 2) we must check the links and domain

eg)https://paytm.com     and      https://paytrn
      (Correct)                       (Fake)
